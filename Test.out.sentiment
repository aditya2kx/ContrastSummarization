{"text":"OK the food: appetizer free because of the wait, nice touch, we had the anti-pasto which was not at all what we expected yet thouroughly delightful.","stars":5}
{"text":"Fresh beets, baby carrots, cheese, Sopprosetta, and fennel - very flavorful.","stars":5}
{"text":"Pizza was good, the crust is really what makes it great, toppings were ok, my daughter prefers traditional pepperoni and sausage to the local schreiners sausage and supressetta (don't know how to spell).","stars":5}
{"text":"Flourless chocolate cake with vanilla bean cream was an excellent end to a great meal.","stars":5}
{"text":"The pizza and service at the pizzeria was great, as it is always.","stars":4}
{"text":"Wise Guy = Damn good pizza","stars":4}
{"text":"When I held up the pizza to the light, I could blasted see through it!","stars":1}
{"text":"The pizza was good, not great.","stars":3}
{"text":"Interesting combinations of ingredients on most pies.","stars":3}
{"text":"Couldn't have been more disappointed by the margherita pie.","stars":3}
{"text":"Honestly, if you can't make a plain cheese pizza work what good are you?","stars":3}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza anywhere.","stars":5}
{"text":"The pizza was very good and the bottle of wine we got was fine - I guess I'm a bit spoiled by Italian pizza (not to be confused with Chicago-style) in my hometown though, as this place seemed solid but not special.","stars":3}
{"text":"Definitely a quality brick oven pizza with seemingly fresh ingredients though, and an enjoyable evening once you can get in.","stars":3}
{"text":"As an unabashed food nerd (a term I much prefer to foodie), I was undeterred by the hours wait time.","stars":4}
{"text":"I just pack my kindle and grab a glass of wine from the wine bar next door.","stars":4}
{"text":"Now the first time I was at PB, I had to have the magherita (you know me, it you can't make a good magherita, you have no reason to be in business).","stars":4}
{"text":"It was good, not as good as I've tasted in Italy but superior to most pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"The crust was beyond perfect - light, bubbly, but not bready.","stars":4}
{"text":"I couldn't stop eating my pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"However, it could have used a lighter hand with the smoked mozzarella.","stars":4}
{"text":"It overwhelmed the delicious onions and fennel sausage.","stars":4}
{"text":"The best view is at the bar watching the guys craft the pizzas.","stars":4}
{"text":"You just can't get pizza like this.","stars":5}
{"text":"The taste and quality is top notch.","stars":5}
{"text":"They got a bar right next door with appetizers and drinks which makes the time fly by, like your not even waiting.","stars":5}
{"text":"Pizza Bianco has the best wood fired pizzas.","stars":5}
{"text":"Make sure to add mushrooms to the wise guy for a taste sensation.","stars":5}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had...hands down.","stars":5}
{"text":"In fact, I've been now 3 times before writing this review as I wanted to make sure my 'best pizza' claim was true.","stars":5}
{"text":"Each time I've had a different pizza and each time I've walked away wanting more.","stars":5}
{"text":"The crust is amazing and it is cool to watch them make the pizzas.","stars":5}
{"text":"Best time to go is for lunch...but get there early as it fills up quick.","stars":5}
{"text":"Being an aspiring foodie and someone who is very judgmental of pizza, these are big shoes to fill.","stars":5}
{"text":"Myself and a good friend went on a Friday around 12:15, I was a little nervous about getting in and out in the needed time, knowing that it was a small place and could have hours of wait time for dinner.","stars":5}
{"text":"We both ordered coke lights (apparently the Italian version of diet coke) and they came in the adorable classic glass bottles and were very tasty.","stars":5}
{"text":"We asked our server if we could only order one pizza which one he would suggest.","stars":5}
{"text":"He told us the Biancoverde with added prosciutto was the one to get, so we went for it.","stars":5}
{"text":"This pizza was tasty.","stars":5}
{"text":"Thin crust and oh so flavorful, the ricotta and cheese were amazing, and the prosciutto was yummy, not overly salty like some can be.","stars":5}
{"text":"It can seem a little pricey, our one pizza was $24 but it fed both of us comfortably.","stars":5}
{"text":"Pizzeria Bianco is the best pizza in town, nay... the country.","stars":5}
{"text":"If you can't deal with the wait, and you need to hurry up and eat so that you can scurry home to see who gets voted off American Idol, then perhaps Domino's is your choice.","stars":5}
{"text":"Sit with a glass of wine or beer and chat with your friends.","stars":5}
{"text":"But all that drinking and chatting will never compare to the loveliness and perfection that is the pizza.","stars":5}
{"text":"And don't think I forgot you my precious antipasto, you are my companion 'till the end.","stars":5}
{"text":"Go for a few drinks at the bar next door and your time will fly by.","stars":5}
{"text":"Biancoverde, Wiseguy, Rosa and Margherita pizzas were shared amongst friends.","stars":5}
{"text":"By unanimous decision, Margherita was the top choice.","stars":5}
{"text":"Tip: Add prosciutto americano onto the Margherita pizza and feel the flavor explode in your mouth.","stars":5}
{"text":"Your taste buds will thank you.","stars":5}
{"text":"Despite the lines, the crowds, and the wait, I found Pizzeria Bianco to be a worthwhile dining experience....even though it didn't fit into my Chicago-style definition of pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"This isn't the place to loosen up, stuff yourself silly , and quaff beer by the pitcher.","stars":4}
{"text":"Right around this time I'm thinking it'd be nice if we could wait in a bar, chat over a beer, and somehow be summoned back  when our table was ready.","stars":4}
{"text":"We were quickly shooshed over to a rather pleasant bar next door where the lengthy wait passed by painlessly as we sipped drinks and chatted up the locals.","stars":4}
{"text":"The bar was crowded too....and I had my doubts about the restaurant staff's claim of a Saint Bernard-like ability to find us in the crush of humanity....but find us they did, and minutes later we were seated and perusing the bill of fare.","stars":4}
{"text":"Pizza's only came in thin crust, and were served in only one size.","stars":4}
{"text":"There was no build-your-own list of toppings, and the pre-defined combinations didn't look anything like standard pizza parlor fair.","stars":4}
{"text":"On the other hand, the sizable wood-fired pizza oven in the corner looked fascinating, and Bianco himself was running the kitchen with a focus and dedication that bordered on religious fanaticism.","stars":4}
{"text":"Tires hit pavement when the pizzas showed up.","stars":4}
{"text":"I've gotta say it was dang tasty, and I didn't regret the wait or the expense one bit.","stars":4}
{"text":"Still, if you're craving a more Chicago-style pizza, this just doesn't cut it.","stars":4}
{"text":"The ingredients are fantastic, the preparation is perfect, and the ambiance isn't lacking in the slightest......","stars":4}
{"text":"but halfway through my first pie I found myself yearning for something thicker, and wound up fighting the urge to grab two pieces at once or fold one over to simulate a thicker slice.","stars":4}
{"text":"If, like myself, you hail from San Francisco, it's similar to Pauline's Pizza ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/tIzKxpADKMMmzDr5n07lQg ) on Valencia between 14th and Duboce.","stars":4}
{"text":"It was tasty, and it was without doubt a high-quality pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"East Coasters with their love for a thinner, more spartan pie will probably see it's virtues....But as for myself, I see it in the same way I do Pauline's Pizza in San Francisco...memorable and worth the visit, but it  never comes to mind when the pizza craving rears it's ugly head...","stars":4}
{"text":"Yes, this pizza really is as good as it gets!","stars":5}
{"text":"The flavors and the dough are epic.","stars":5}
{"text":"They serve lunch now, so there is no need to wait in the long dinner lines!","stars":5}
{"text":"I LOVE neapolitan style pizza.","stars":5}
{"text":"Here in Dallas, I go to Cavalli's on a regular basis and love it.","stars":5}
{"text":"I knew I would love Bianco, the big question is would I think it is the 'best pizza in America'?","stars":5}
{"text":"Honestly, any certified Neapolitan pizza place is going to be nearly as good as Bianco.","stars":5}
{"text":"It's not rocket science, it's just the right oven and the right ingredients and the right touch.","stars":5}
{"text":"The crust is amazing.","stars":5}
{"text":"It's perfectly done, with just enough burnt on the edges for my taste.","stars":5}
{"text":"(I tend to leave some crust edge.)","stars":5}
{"text":"The toppings are perfect, the Sopprasata was amazing, the fennel sausage was great, the sauce was perfect.","stars":5}
{"text":"It's basically the perfect pizza.","stars":5}
{"text":"It made me realize that I've tasted the best pizza out there and it is only slightly better than some local places.","stars":5}
{"text":"I guess I should look at it in a good way, that I can drive 10 minutes and get an amazing pizza at Cavalli any day of the week, a pizza that rivals the best in America.","stars":5}
{"text":"If you get here and are standing in line because it's supposed to be this totally awesome pizza, just go somewhere else.","stars":3}
{"text":"It's good pizza, and you should try it, but it's not worth the wait.","stars":3}
{"text":"The lobster bisque soup could have been a meal all unto itself.","stars":4}
{"text":"The BBQ pork sandwich was phenomenal.","stars":4}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had!","stars":5}
{"text":"The bar  serves appetizers and drinks while you wait which helps but odds are you will still have about 2 hours to kill.","stars":5}
{"text":"I also love the bar next door to get a few bottles of wine in ya while you wait 3 hours","stars":5}
{"text":"But, Jesus Tiberius CHRIST, was the food worth it!","stars":5}
{"text":"Mind you, I had been previously assured that the pizza was delicious, but I wasn't quite aware that it would be completely unlike anything I've stuffed down my gob prior.","stars":5}
{"text":"Fresh tomatoes, fresh dough, fresh cheese, fresh seasonings, Fresh Prince (psyche!)","stars":5}
{"text":"The tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, not some canned, processed rubbish.","stars":5}
{"text":"I could make a meal of the crust, alone.","stars":5}
{"text":"I'm not even a food snob about this sort of thing.","stars":5}
{"text":"I happily proclaim that Little Caesars' 5 1/2 dollar pizzas are some of the yummiest pies around.","stars":5}
{"text":"But this pizza is truly Ninja Turtle-worthy.","stars":5}
{"text":"I want to buy the guy who made it a drink - non-alcoholic, mind you, because an adult beverage might prompt him to take a break.","stars":5}
{"text":"I finally made it to the Mecca of pizza.... I have been a pizza nut for a while.","stars":5}
{"text":"I have been makin pizza and italian food professionally for 15 years and I have always wanted to try this place.","stars":5}
{"text":"I loved the simplicity of the menu and freshness of the ingredients.","stars":5}
{"text":"The bread was nice.","stars":5}
{"text":"We got several pizzas and I can't say I had a favorite!","stars":5}
{"text":"Maybe the pistachio...or maybe the sausage one....well the margherita was also really good......","stars":5}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try this pizza for a few years now.","stars":3}
{"text":"Comparing deep dish pizza to a thinner east coast style of pizza doesn't make much sense.","stars":3}
{"text":"We took a quick walk across the street to the bar that has more than beer and wine, because i wanted neither.","stars":3}
{"text":"After some minor drinking and an appetizer, and some less than enjoyable conversation from my 'new friends', we went back over, 15 minutes short of finally being sat at a table.","stars":3}
{"text":"We sat down, and i received the highlight of my meal.","stars":3}
{"text":"For those that don't know, this is pretty much Sprite made from real cane sugar.","stars":3}
{"text":"After I guzzled down my Bubble Up, my Pizza promptly arrived (Margherita with Fennel Sausage and Basil).","stars":3}
{"text":"I looked for the biggest slice, and dug in.","stars":3}
{"text":"Although it was decent, it doesn't warrant the wait, and to say this pizza is nationally ranked is laughable.","stars":3}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I would eat it again, just call me when you are about to be sat and I'll let you know what I want, that way when I get there my pizza will be ready, because it is far from worth a 2 hour wait.","stars":3}
{"text":"this is NOT the best pizza in phoenix and NOT the best pizza in the USA.","stars":2}
{"text":"come on now i saw this place on oprah because gail king was combing the country to get the best pizza and names this place.","stars":2}
{"text":"maybe this is appetizer style pizza?","stars":2}
{"text":"we had the margherita pizza and the sausage and mushroom pizza- both which have some fru-fru names.","stars":2}
{"text":"it's fake pizza!","stars":2}
{"text":"Well, it has been a loooonnnnggg wait... we finally got to try '  Americas Best Pizza' I can die now... don't understand all the hype.","stars":3}
{"text":"If it weren't for wonderful company and three or so beers, I'm not even sure I could honestly say it was a good evening.","stars":3}
{"text":"Was a good tasting Caprese salad, and the pizza was ok,... the waiter was wonderful, and pretty cute....   I also have a thing for restaurant bathrooms.... not WOW... was hoping for something great but it was just ok   I think this is a case of too much talk, not enough product.","stars":3}
{"text":"This place is reminiscent of thin-crust Neapolitan pizza I've had in Italy - who would have thought?","stars":5}
{"text":"The first time I came here a couple years back I accidentally sprinkled salt (thinking it was fresh mozzarella) all over my pizza.","stars":5}
{"text":"I heard the owner farms his own ingredients on-site and make his own mozzarella daily.","stars":5}
{"text":"I usually order the Wiseguy w/ fennel sausage.","stars":5}
{"text":"The adjacent bar is charming and has decent wines by the glass.","stars":5}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and smiling service.","stars":5}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that Mr. Bianco's special ingredient is love.","stars":5}
{"text":"The food is very good.","stars":1}
{"text":"It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions.","stars":1}
{"text":"The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.","stars":1}
{"text":"The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.","stars":1}
{"text":"As a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft.","stars":1}
{"text":"While I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.","stars":1}
{"text":"The pizza is classic Neopolitan and very good as they were one of the first ones to offer this style since 1994, so I give them great props for that.","stars":3}
{"text":"There are just now so many others offering similar styled pizza with unique and more flavorful crust offerings.","stars":3}
{"text":"If I hadn't been to so many other places (see my pizza list), I would probably give them 4 stars.","stars":3}
{"text":"I tried the margherita pizza with sausage and it was flavorful, and the crust was nice and chewy.","stars":3}
{"text":"Tip to remember for next time is to go next door to order your beer and then bring it in (I think they allow that since they are same ownership.","stars":3}
{"text":"Might be great for area - but I've had better Neapolitan pizza in the US (including my favorite little place back home Pupatella).","stars":3}
{"text":"I did get to introduce my friend to Neapolitan style pizza - something he'd never had - but not sure I'd do the hour plus wait here again.","stars":3}
{"text":"We ended up sitting at the bar since that's what opened up first and the bartender was great and didn't mind me practicing my Italian on him.","stars":3}
{"text":"The toppings are all top rate on the pies, the sauce fragrant and flavorful, but alas the cheese and crust were a little disappointing - the crust in particular lacked flavor).","stars":3}
{"text":"Our pies: MARGHERITA - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil (my staple for judging any Neapolitan pizzaiola's offerings - Really would never get this again; very disappointed in this pie)  SONNY BOY - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives (solid pie - great toppings make up for the flavor-lacking crust)  WISEGUY - Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage (best we had - perfect blend of flavors and aromas)   I'm giving Bianco 3 stars even though I've had better Neapolitan pizza.","stars":3}
{"text":"But I really was fairly Meh about their much lauded pizza.","stars":3}
{"text":"Great food, if just slightly overhyped.","stars":4}
{"text":"It's a cute building in a great location with friendly staff, but does not win my vote for best pizza in Phoenix, sorry!","stars":4}
{"text":"This means that the pizza in NY is really awfull or bianco is a God send.","stars":4}
{"text":"Look it's good pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"Is the pizza so good that once you take a bite commit illegal activities to feed your habit  ???","stars":4}
{"text":"It's good, fresh, and worth trying?","stars":4}
{"text":"Although there is a nice wine bar next door and cheap beer.","stars":4}
{"text":"The caprese salad, mainly the mozzarella was to die for.","stars":4}
{"text":"The flavor coming out of it, the richness, the cream, the silkiness of it was stellar.","stars":4}
{"text":"The basil was very strong as well.","stars":4}
{"text":"I had the Sonny Boy pizza that from a set of some very simple ingredients, a perfect pizza was born.","stars":4}
{"text":"An almost buttery crust, mild yet robust olives, salami, a perfect amount of cheese, and a tomato sauce that was not too acidic...  But man oh man, that crust is fantastic, the fired brick oven just adds a flavor and complexity to the flavors that makes you wish one could just pour liquid smoke on your crust and get the same results at home...    Now I'll have to come back for more!","stars":4}
{"text":"Delicious and worth trying, but build into your evening the waiting time.","stars":4}
{"text":"I recommend hanging out next door and having a cocktail.","stars":4}
{"text":"As for the food, the pizza is good, but there is a lot of other good pizza in Phoenix (like LGO) but their sides and salads are phenomenal!","stars":4}
{"text":"In short: Waited 2 1/2 hours for the best pizza I've ever had.","stars":5}
{"text":"The wine bar next door has $4 Hop Knots: highly recommended.","stars":5}
{"text":"For the Value: 5 Big Fat Stars (my boyfriend & I spent $45 together for our whole meal)  Plan for next time: someone gets us on the list and we all hang out at my house (10 minutes away) having wine and appetizers, playing Apples to Apples while we wait.","stars":5}
{"text":"The service was very good, but the pizza was completely flavorless.","stars":3}
{"text":"The sauce was the strongest point, but the cheese and sausage were completely bland.","stars":3}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, amazing service, adorable location.","stars":5}
{"text":"If the wait is long, go next door for a drink!","stars":5}
{"text":"It is a great pizza with an awesome crust and fresh, delicious toppings.","stars":4}
{"text":"Higher end than your standard NY pizza, but won't say its better or worse than any other style.","stars":4}
{"text":"All in all, a great pizza...but I had immediate seating.","stars":4}
{"text":"Really a 4.5  The pizza is serious here.","stars":4}
{"text":"Nancy Silverton mentioned it was one of the inspirations for her pizza, so I had to try it out.","stars":4}
{"text":"It is a simple dough (not like Silverton's).","stars":4}
{"text":"Was told it is made with OO flour, fresh yeast cake, water, sea salt, and little bit of dough from the day before.","stars":4}
{"text":"The wood burning brick oven looks to be the real deal, with a thick black smoke floating a few inches above the cooking surface.","stars":4}
{"text":"Had the margherita, biancoverde, and Sonny Boy.","stars":4}
{"text":"All where good and only the highest quality ingredients are used.","stars":4}
{"text":"The crust had enough charred to imbue with the earthy scent and quality that makes crust so habit forming.","stars":4}
{"text":"The stand out was the margherita.","stars":4}
{"text":"The oven does wonders for the tomato sauce and really brings it alive.","stars":4}
{"text":"Probably one of the best margherita I have ever and had works perfectly with the simplicity of the dough.","stars":4}
{"text":"The gaeta olives on the Sonny Boy are excellent but paired with the salami made for a slightly rich pie.","stars":4}
{"text":"Lastly, the cheeses of the biancoverde paired well with the sharpness of the arugula and highlighted their fresh richness.","stars":4}
{"text":"An excellent pie overall.","stars":4}
{"text":"There are very nice benches outside to enjoy a beer while waiting for your table.","stars":4}
{"text":"However, keep in mind that this place is rated the best pizza in the US, so having high expectations is not necessarily unfair.","stars":4}
{"text":"We had no issue with the wait and I think having some time to drink and chat at the cozy bar next door was a great way to kick-off our soon to be 'mind blowing' pizza.","stars":4}
{"text":"We got sat at the bar top and ordered two pizzas--the margarita and the fennel & sausage.","stars":4}
{"text":"The pizzas were good, but not great.","stars":4}
ss{"text":"The crust was soggy and it just didn't hit the taste buds the right way for us.","stars":4}
{"text":"Definitely worth going to and worth the wait (to at least try it once), but I don't see myself going back anytime soon to get my pizza fix.","stars":4}
{"text":"I prefer the margarita pizza at LGO.","stars":4}
